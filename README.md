## mpv-audio.vim

Turn Vim/Neovim in a audio player...kind of.

Adds commands (see `:help mpv-audio.vim`) that allow you to play files and URLs
under the cursor using mpv.


## Installation

Use your favorite vim plugin manager and install
`https://github.com/francium/mpv-audio.vim`.

Make sure you also have mpv installed. See <https://mpv.io/installation/>.

Make sure `mpv` is in your `$PATH` and things should work correctly. You can
verify this by running `mpv --version` in a terminal. The plugin will likely not
work on Windows currently.
